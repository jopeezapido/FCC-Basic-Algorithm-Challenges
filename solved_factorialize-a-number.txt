-Factorialize A Number-

Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Arithmetic Operators

Required:
- Factorial of the provided integer

What we need:
- We need an empty array where to put the factorials in
	>We need a loop to get each of the factorials of num
	>We need to push the factorials from the loop to the array
- We need to access each of the element in that array and get their value
- We need to perform a function to multiply all those values in the array to each other
	- we need a loop to to access each element

Steps:
- Create a 'box' to put value in so that it is an array type (easliy looped and accessed)
- Loop through num from 0
- Inside each of that loop, return the number that the loop passes
