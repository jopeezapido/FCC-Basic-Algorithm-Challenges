Seek and Destroy

You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:

Arguments object
Array.prototype.filter()

Required:
- A modified array without the value/s defined in the second and succeeding arguments.

Steps:
- Transform the arguments into an array
	> Use the .slice and .call function to turn the arguments into an array.
- Get the values of the second and suceeding elements in the newly formed array.
	>
- Filter out the 1st array using the values of the second and succeeding elements


Notes:
- Arguments object is not an array
